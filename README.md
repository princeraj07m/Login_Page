## Description

This project is a user-friendly login page designed with a focus on simplicity and security. It features a clean and responsive frontend built using modern web technologies, and a robust backend powered by Node.js and Express, with secure user authentication handled through SQL.

## Frontend

The frontend is crafted with:

*   **HTML:** Providing a semantic and accessible structure for the login interface.
*   **CSS:** Delivering a visually appealing and responsive design for optimal user experience across devices.
*   **JavaScript:** Implementing interactive elements and handling communication with the backend API for user authentication.

## Backend

The backend infrastructure is built upon:

*   **Node.js:** A runtime environment for executing JavaScript server-side.
*   **Express:** A lightweight Node.js framework streamlining the development of web applications and APIs.
*   **SQL:** A relational database management system for securely storing and managing user credentials.

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
2.  Navigate to the backend directory:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
3.  Install the required backend dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  Start the backend server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
5.  Open the `frontend/index.html` file in your preferred web browser to access the login page.
